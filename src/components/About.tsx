      <H2>About Me</H2>
      <P>
        My venture into the world of Computer Science started in high school
        when I had my first programming class. The problem-solving aspects of
        coding fascinated me- how a few lines of code could convert an idea into
        an application. Over the past three years of my work as a Frontend
        Developer, I have developed strong skills in JavaScript, React, and
        modern web technologies, building seamless and interactive user
        experiences. I enjoy writing clean code while constantly keeping up with
        modern practices and techniques in the fast-paced tech world. My passion
        lies in crafting intuitive UIs and my goal is to unite both performance
        and aesthetics to provide users with an enjoyable experience.
